# Rules of Blackjack

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.

<h2>Card Values</h2>

<ul>
<li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>

<li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>

<li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more beneficial to the hand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Game Setup</h2>
Each player is dealt two cards face up.

<h2>Player's Turn</h2>

<b>Hit</b>: The player can request additional cards to improve their hand value. This is called "hitting".

<b>Stand</b>: The player can choose to keep their current hand and end their turn. This is called "standing".
The player can hit as many times as they want but should be cautious not to exceed 21, as this results in a bust and an immediate loss of the game.

<h2>Dealer's Turn</h2>

Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.

<h2>Winning Conditions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If a player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.</li>

<li>If the dealer busts, any remaining players win.</li>

<li>If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the closest hand value to 21 wins.</li>

<li>If the player's hand value equals the dealer's hand value, it is a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.</li>
</ul>
